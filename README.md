The universe of the Game of Life is an infinite, two-dimensional orthogonal grid of square cells,
each of which is in one of two possible states, live or dead (or populated and unpopulated,
respectively). Every cell interacts with its eight neighbours, which are the cells that are
horizontally, vertically, or diagonally adjacent. At each step in time, the following transitions
occur:

1. Any live cell with fewer than two live neighbours dies, as if by underpopulation.
2. Any live cell with two or three live neighbours lives on to the next generation.
3. Any live cell with more than three live neighbours dies, as if by overpopulation.
4. Any dead cell with exactly three live neighbours becomes a live cell, as if by reproduction.

## üõ†Ô∏è Prerequisite

1. Ruby 3.1.2
2. Bundler 2.3.20

## ‚öôÔ∏è Install dependencies

```
bundle install
bundle binstubs --all
```

## üèóÔ∏è How to build

To build this project you can run:

```bash
gem install gem-release
gem build
gem install ./conway-1.0.0.gem
```

in your root directory of the project.

## üöÄ How to use

You can simply play this game by running this command:

```bash
ruby lib/main.rb
```

The program will run, and you will be prompted to input a source file:

```
Input the filename path: ...
```

you can use the examples in [inputs](./inputs), an example would be:

```
Input the filename path: inputs/blinker.txt
```

After that, you can watch the show üòé

**Note:**

- If you want to stop the program, you can use `CTRL + C`.
- In some cases the cells doesn't seem to move, this is because the program will follow the movement
  of the cells.
- The program will continue to prompt until valid input file is received (invalid files examples
  are `inputs/invalid.txt` and `inputs/empty.txt`).

## üß™ How to test

You need to install dependencies first, then run this command:

```bash
bin/rspec --require spec_helper --format doc
```

After running command above, you can see the test coverage by `open coverage/index.html`.

## ‚úÖ How to lint

You need to install dependencies first, then run this command

```bash
bin/rubocop lib spec --autocorrect
```
